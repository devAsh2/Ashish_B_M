# Problem-4: Get the total count of number listed in the dictionary which is 
# multiple of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
#   (examples)
#   input: [1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]
#   Output: 
#     {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}

# Problem statement: counting how many numbers in a list are divisible by each digit
#                    from 1 to 9.

# algorithm
# keep i pointer on start of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# keep j pointer on start of input : [1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]
# for each element at i, check if j has an element which is a multiple
#  yes if increment ith value+=1 else move on
# store in hashmap i.e {} in python
